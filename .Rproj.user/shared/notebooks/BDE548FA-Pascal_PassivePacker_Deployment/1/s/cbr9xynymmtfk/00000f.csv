Targeting beaked whales (family Ziphiidae), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), and dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (genus Kogia), this large scale acoustic survey used drifting acoustic buoys to obtain improved data for estimating population size for these species. This survey also aimed to improve our ability to identify species specific acoustic calls. Lastly, a pilot experiment was conducted as a part of this survey to deploy acoustic instruments near seamounts and explore the hypothesis that beaked whale occurrence is associated with these topographic seafloor features.'"

Each DASBR was composed of at least two hydrophones at 100 meter depth and an acoustic recorder (several drifts had 3 hydrophones and two recorders). While the primary species of interests were beaked whales, sperm whales, and Kogia, these data have been analyzed for acoustic presence of a wide variety of cetacean species as well as soundscape analysis.'"
