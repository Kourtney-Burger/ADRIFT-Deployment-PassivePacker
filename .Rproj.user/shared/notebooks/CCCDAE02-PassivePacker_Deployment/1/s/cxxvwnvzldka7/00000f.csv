This survey was a collaboration between the Southwest Fisheries Science Centerâ€™s (SWFSC) Fishery Resource Division (FRD) and Marine Mammal and Turtle Division (MMTD). The survey included oceanographic measurements, use of multi-frequency echosounders, surface trawls, vertically and obliquely integrating net tows, continuous underway fish egg sampling, visual line-transect surveys for marine mammals, photographic capture-recapture studies of marine mammals, strip transect surveys for seabirds, and passive acoustic surveys of marine mammals using Drifting Acoustic Spar Buoy Recorders (DASBRs). The recordings collected in this project have been analyzed to detect echolocation signals from beaked whales, sperm whales, and dwarf and pygmy sperm whales.'"

DASBRs are free floating instruments with two hydrophones, in a vertical array, and a digital recorder. CCES 2018 was the second survey conducted under the Pacific Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (PacMAPPS), supported by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the US Navy, and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). This study conducts annual cetacean and ecosystem surveys throughout the North Pacific and generates data products used by all three agencies to meet regulatory requirements pertaining to protected species.'
