DASBRs are free floating instruments with two hydrophones, in a vertical array, and a digital recorder. CCES 2018 was the second survey conducted under the Pacific Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (PacMAPPS), supported by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the US Navy, and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). This study conducts annual cetacean and ecosystem surveys throughout the North Pacific and generates data products used by all three agencies to meet regulatory requirements pertaining to protected species.", "PURPOSE": "The 2018 California Current Ecosystem Survey (CCES) was a multidisciplinary survey of the marine ecosystem from southern British Columbia, Canada to northern Baja California, Mexico. This survey was a collaboration between the Southwest Fisheries Science Center\u2019s (SWFSC) Fishery Resource Division (FRD) and Marine Mammal and Turtle Division (MMTD). The survey included oceanographic measurements, use of multi-frequency echosounders, surface trawls, vertically and obliquely integrating net tows, continuous underway fish egg sampling, visual line-transect surveys for marine mammals, photographic capture-recapture studies of marine mammals, strip transect surveys for seabirds, and passive acoustic surveys of marine mammals using Drifting Acoustic Spar Buoy Recorders (DASBRs). The recordings collected in this project have been analyzed to detect echolocation signals from beaked whales, sperm whales, and dwarf and pygmy sperm whales.", "CHANNELS": {"1": {"CHANNEL_START": "2018-08-05T15:27:50", "CHANNEL_END": "2018-09-22T18:09:50", "SENSOR": "1", "SAMPLING_DETAILS": {"SAMPLING": [{"START": "2018-08-05T15:27:50", "END": "2018-09-22T18:09:50", "SAMPLE_RATE": "288", "SAMPLE_BITS": "16"}], "GAIN": [], "DUTY_CYCLE": [{"START": "2018-08-05T15:27:50", "END": "2018-09-22T18:09:50", "DURATION": "2", "INTERVAL": "20"}]}}, "2": {"CHANNEL_START": "2018-08-05T15:27:50", "CHANNEL_END": "2018-09-22T18:09:50", "SENSOR": "2", "SAMPLING_DETAILS": {"SAMPLING": [{"START": "2018-08-05T15:27:50", "END": "2018-09-22T18:09:50", "SAMPLE_RATE": "288", "SAMPLE_BITS": "16"}], "GAIN": [], "DUTY_CYCLE": [{"START": "2018-08-05T15:27:50", "END": "2018-09-22T18:09:50", "DURATION": "2", "INTERVAL": "20"}]}}}, "QUALITY_DETAILS": {"analyst": "Cory Hom-Weaver", "analyst_uuid": "8f9f3e13-3571-436d-b1fd-6e779acd9a9f", "quality_details": [{"quality": "Good", "low_freq": "20", "high_freq": "288000", "start": "2018-08-05T15:27:50", "end": "2018-09-22T18:09:50", "comments": "Refer to CCES_007_500Hz_LF_Noise_Log.xls for detailed noise logs.", "channels": "1"}], "method": "", "objectives": "", "abstract": ""}, "PLATFORM_NAME": "Drifter", "INSTRUMENT_TYPE": "SoundTrap 4300 HF", "INSTRUMENT_ID": "1208791071", "DEPLOYMENT": {"DEPLOYMENT_TIME": "2018-08-05T14:48:00", "RECOVERY_TIME": "2018-10-22T09:00:00", "AUDIO_START": "2018-08-05T15:27:50", "AUDIO_END": "2018-09-22T18:09:50", "DEPLOY_TYPE": "Mobile Marine", "SEA_AREA": "North Pacific Ocean", "DEPLOY_SHIP": "R/V Ruben Lasker", "FILES": "Z:/METADATA/CCES_2018/CCES_007/CCES_007_GPS/CCES_007_GPS.csv", "POSITION_DETAILS": "Satellite gps"}, "DATASET_DETAILS": {"TYPE": "Raw", "SUB_TYPE": "Audio", "SOURCE_PATH": "F:/SWFSC-CCES_CCES2018_Test_7/data/acoustic_files", "DATA_COMMENT": "Drift 7 grounded and was retrieved by Gary Friedrichson using his small boat from shore around 1900 UTC on 9/22/2018, low frequency strumming under 100 Hz"}, "CALIBRATION_INFO": {"CAL_STATE": "Factory Calibrated", "CAL_DOCS_PATH": "F:/CCES_RawData/Metadata/CalibrationInfo", "SENSITIVITY": "", "FREQUENCY": "", "GAIN": "", "COMMENT": "This dataset is composed of multichannel recorders with different types of hydrophones, each with its own unique sensitivity and frequency range.
